# Deep Learning for Fashion MNIST: Neural Network Classification

## Description

This project implements a deep learning model using TensorFlow and Keras to classify images from the Fashion MNIST dataset. The dataset consists of 70,000 grayscale images of 10 different clothing categories. The neural network is trained to recognize these categories based on the pixel values of the images. The project demonstrates the power of deep learning in image classification tasks and serves as a foundation for understanding neural networks and computer vision applications.

The model is designed to achieve high accuracy using various deep learning techniques, including dropout for regularization, batch normalization for stable training, and an optimized architecture for improved performance.

## Features

- Uses the Fashion MNIST dataset for image classification
- Implements a deep neural network with layers such as Dense, Dropout, BatchNormalization, and Flatten
- Applies batch normalization to improve training stability
- Uses dropout to prevent overfitting
- Visualizes training loss, accuracy, and predictions
- Evaluates model performance using accuracy metrics
- Supports hyperparameter tuning for optimization

## Dataset

The Fashion MNIST dataset is a collection of 70,000 grayscale images, each measuring 28x28 pixels. It consists of:

- **60,000 training images**
- **10,000 test images**

Each image belongs to one of the 10 categories:

1. T-shirt/top
2. Trouser
3. Pullover
4. Dress
5. Coat
6. Sandal
7. Shirt
8. Sneaker
9. Bag
10. Ankle boot

The dataset is a popular benchmark for machine learning models in image classification, often used as an alternative to the classic MNIST dataset of handwritten digits.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd your-repository
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install tensorflow keras numpy matplotlib pandas jupyter
   ```

## Usage

Run the Jupyter Notebook to train and test the model:

```sh
jupyter notebook FashionMnist.ipynb
```

### Training the Model

The model is trained using categorical cross-entropy loss and the Adam optimizer. You can adjust the number of epochs and batch size to experiment with training performance.

### Evaluating Performance

After training, the model is evaluated using:

- Accuracy score on test data
- Confusion matrix to analyze classification errors
- Sample predictions with visualized images

## Model Architecture

The neural network consists of:

- **Flatten layer**: Converts 2D image data into 1D for the neural network
- **Dense layers with ReLU activation**: Extracts features from image data
- **Batch Normalization**: Stabilizes training and speeds up convergence
- **Dropout layers**: Reduces overfitting by randomly deactivating neurons during training
- **Output layer with Softmax activation**: Generates probabilities for each class (multi-class classification)

## Results and Analysis

The trained model achieves a high accuracy on the Fashion MNIST test set. Performance can be improved further using:

- Data augmentation to increase dataset diversity
- Experimenting with different architectures (e.g., CNNs for better accuracy)
- Fine-tuning hyperparameters like learning rate and batch size
